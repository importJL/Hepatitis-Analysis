# Hepatitis Analysis
A repository for analysis of patient-drawn blood samples for differentiating patients with various liver diseases ("acute" hepatitis C, fibrosis, cirrhosis).  Data science and machine learning tools used involve `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `xgboost` modules.  As samples are heavily biased on patients with normal liver conditions, incorporation of `imblearn` is used to offset these changes using various balance-attenuating algorithms.

You may check with in the browser `Hepatitis_C.ipynb` file or clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/jedi3nigma/Hepatitis-Analysis/`
